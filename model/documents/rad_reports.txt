RADIOLOGY REPORT
Patient: Leo Daniels  DOB: 07/15/1974  Age: 50 y
Study: MRI RIGHT KNEE (WITHOUT IV CONTRAST)
Study Date: 05/22/2025
Accession #: —not available—  Ordering Physician: Amanda Reynolds, MD

CLINICAL INDICATION
Acute right‑knee pain after non‑contact soccer activity; prior anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction suspected but operative records unavailable. Rule out internal derangement.

TECHNIQUE
Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the right knee obtained on a 3 T system without intravenous contrast. Standard proton‑density, T2‑weighted fat‑saturated, and gradient‑echo sequences performed in sagittal, coronal, and axial planes.

FINDINGS
BONES / CARTILAGE

No acute fracture or marrow contusion.

Mild chondral thinning with small marginal osteophytes in the medial femorotibial compartment (Kellgren‑Lawrence grade 2).

Articular cartilage otherwise preserved; trochlear facet shows moderate chondrosis.

MENISCI

Medial meniscus: Complex tear involving posterior horn and body. Extrusion of the body measuring approximately 4 mm beyond the medial tibial plateau.

Lateral meniscus: Normal morphology and signal; no tear.

LIGAMENTS

ACL: Prior graft is torn—marked fiber discontinuity and fraying (complete failure).

PCL: Intact, normal thickness and signal.

MCL: Thickened with intraligamentous edema near femoral attachment, consistent with grade II sprain (partial tear).

LCL: Intact with normal low signal.

MPFL: Partial fiber disruption adjacent to patellar insertion—compatible with partial tear.

TENDONS / EXTENSOR MECHANISM
Quadriceps and patellar tendons intact.
Semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris tendons without abnormality.

JOINT FLUID / SOFT TISSUES
Moderate joint effusion distending the suprapatellar recess.
Baker (popliteal) cyst present, measuring 2.3 × 1.1 cm, thin‑walled, no signs of rupture.
No loose bodies or soft‑tissue mass.

Neurovascular structures grossly unremarkable.

IMPRESSION
Complete tear of prior ACL graft.

Complex medial meniscal tear with 4 mm medial meniscal extrusion.

Partial MCL sprain and partial MPFL tear; PCL and LCL intact.

Moderate joint effusion.

Mild medial‑compartment and moderate patellofemoral osteoarthritis; lateral compartment spared.

Small Baker cyst without evidence of rupture.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Orthopedic consultation for possible ACL revision and meniscal repair.

Consider ultrasound‑guided aspiration or corticosteroid injection if effusion symptomatic.

Begin quadriceps‑strengthening physical therapy once clinically appropriate.
