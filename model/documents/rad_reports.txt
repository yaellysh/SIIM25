Examination: MRI at right knee. 
Clinical indication: right knee pain. 
Comparison: none. 
Technique: long TR axial sagittal coronal images of the right knee. 
Findings: menisci lateral and medial menisci are intact.  
Ligaments torn ACL ligament.
Posterior cruciate ligament intact. 
Medial model collateral ligaments intact.
Posterolateral corner structures intact. 
Extensor mechanism: Distal quadriceps of the patellar tendons are intact. 
Patella normally positioned within the femoral groove. 
No retinacular disruption. 
Fluid: no joint fluid or baker's cyst.  
Osis and articular structures: 
Bones: No contusion. 
Media compartment no cartilage disruption. 
Patellofemoral compartment: no cartilage interruption. 
lateral compartment: no lateral cartilage disruption. 
Impression: acute ACL disruption.




Examination: MRI right knee. 
Comparison: examination performed six months ago on 12/11/2024. 
Clinical information: previously repaired ACL tear with recurrent pain.
Technique: long TR axial sagittal coronal images of the right knee were performed.
Findings: menisci: Median lateral meniscus are intact. 
Ligaments: Anterior Cruciate ligament: postsurgical changes from anterior cruciate ligament repair. There's minimal abnormal signal within the ligament, presumably related to postsurgical change. The ligament remains intact.
Posterior cruciate ligament: intact.
Medial lateral collateral ligament: intact. Posterior lateral corner structures colon intact extensor mechanism, a quadceps of pateller tendons are intact period. Patella normally positioned within the Patohemeral groove period of retinacular disruption period.
